I got involved with Odilia basically by accident. I didn&amp;rsquo;t use a screenreader on Linux because the existing options were slow on my PinebookPro and Raspberry Pi. But I really did need one. I can tell you, the amount of times I need to squint, or get really close to the screen is uncountably infinite.</description></item><item><title>BGT Lover</title><link>https://odilia.app/authors/bgt-lover/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:05:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/authors/bgt-lover/</guid><description/></item><item><title>TheFake VIP</title><link>https://odilia.app/authors/thefake-vip/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jan 2022 00:05:47 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/authors/thefake-vip/</guid><description>Iâ€™m a visually impaired computer programmer, web developer, open source advocate, hardware enthusiast, video editor, and, above all, just a complete nerd.
I got involved with this project because I&amp;rsquo;m a huge proponent of free, libre, open source software. Developing the software that runs our lives out in the open increases security, encourages innovation, prevents monopolistic practices and above all, makes technology accessible to everyone, which is the primary goal of the Odilia screen reader project.</description></item></channel></rss>
