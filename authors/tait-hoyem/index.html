<p>I went to school for software development, then quit my first full-time job within 6 months of getting it to work on open-source accessibility tools.</p>
<p>I got involved with Odilia basically by accident.
I didn&rsquo;t use a screenreader on Linux because the existing options were slow on my PinebookPro and Raspberry Pi.
But I really did need one.
I can tell you, the amount of times I need to squint, or get really close to the screen is uncountably infinite.
And yet, there I sat, refusing to accept the fact that I needed a screenreader, because I didn&rsquo;t like the options available to me.</p>
<p>So when I heard about a possible new screenreader for Linux, written in Rust (a language I always wanted an excuse to learn about), I joined the Discord just to <em>observe</em> and <em>comment</em>.
Within a month I started writing code, and within two months I decided that this (and some other projects I&rsquo;m working on) are more important than work and quit to pursue more important things: working for myself and working on open-source accessibility tools;
whenever I have an opportunity to have those two overlap is extra-special!</p>
