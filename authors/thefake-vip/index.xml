The prototype code, while functional, prioritised experimentation over quality, and thus we&amp;rsquo;ll be throwing almost all of it out completely, but the code is far less important than the experience we gained from writing it.
As far as I&amp;rsquo;m concerned, ditching the prototype completely was always part of the plan. From personal experience, large projects always get rewritten after a while, so I figured it would be better to plan for that, and reap the benefits of a clean, modular codebase, hopefully free of bad decisions.</description></item></channel></rss>
