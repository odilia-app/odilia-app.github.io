Currently, we primarily target Linux, however, we plan to support other free operating systems such as *BSD in the future (patches welcome).
The following dependencies are required to build and run Odilia:
Build Dependencies Rust Libclang &amp;gt;= 5.0, required by Rust Bindgensee this page This is required for generating the Rust bindings to libspeech Runtime Dependenceis speech-dispatcher &amp;gt;= 0.</description></item><item><title>Odilia Users Guide</title><link>https://odilia.app/doc/user/guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:27:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/doc/user/guide/</guid><description>Odilia should start speaking immediately when started. Some key bindings may feel familiar, like capslock+b for browse mode and h to go to the next heading.
Some things may feel different. Note that for one thing, Odilia does not change modes automatically for you. This could be added in the future, but we are starting with a very minimal system to begin with; we are happy to expand as feature requests arise.</description></item><item><title>FAQ</title><link>https://odilia.app/doc/user/faq/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:31:00 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/doc/user/faq/</guid><description>Why doesn&amp;rsquo;t my favourite keybinding work? Either one of the following two things have happened:
We haven&amp;rsquo;t implemented functionality for this keybinding as of yet. (Just ask nicely, and we should be able to) The keybinding is different than what you&amp;rsquo;re used to. This can be tweaked by changing the contents of your sohkdrc file. Please feel free to reach out via Github issues, if you think there is something missing.</description></item></channel></rss>
