Welcome to Odilia!

Accessibility on Linux has historically been under-developed,
under-maintained, and therefore not up to modern standards for many blind
people. We’re hear to help with that!

Odilia is a new screen reader for the Linux desktop. It’s written in Rust, for maximum performance and
stability.

<h2>Addons</h2>
<p> You're no longer limited to built-in functionality! Install addons
from third-party developers to extend Odilia with new commands and
abilities. Or, if you're a developer, write your own in one of several
languages.</p>
</div>
<div class=feature>
<h2>Object Nav</h2>
<p>Navigate applications as a tree of accessible objects, making it
easy to interact with parts of the interface that are inaccessible, or
hard to use, using keyboard focus alone.</p>
</div>
<div class=feature>
<h2>OCR</h2>
<p>Use optical character recognition to read text in images or
inaccessible apps, and activate the buttons you need.</p>
</div>
<div class=feature>
<h2>Touch Support</h2>
<p>Use Odilia on your Linux smartphone, tablet, or touch-screen equipped laptop.</p>
</div>
<div class=feature>
<h2>Customisable Input</h2>
<p>Configure any keyboard shortcut, mouse button or touch gesture to
activate any Odilia command, even those provided by addons! You can
customise any default keybinding, either directly in the config file
with a text editor, or in an intuative graphical application.</p>

<h2>Why the Name?</h2>
<p>Odilia, also known as <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odile_of_Alsace>Odile of Alsace</a>, is
the patron saint of the blind, partially sighted, and good eye sight in the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church>Catholic</a> and <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eastern_Orthodox_Church>Eastern
Orthodox</a> churches. We hope that, like God gave Odilia her sight back when
she was baptised, we can, in a sense, return the lost sense to Linux desktop
users, and make using their computer easier and more fun!</p>
<h2>Under Active Development</h2>
<p>This website as well as the software itself is under active development,
please check back at a later stage to see more exciting news and
documentation!</p>
