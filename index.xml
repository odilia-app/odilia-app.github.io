For this reason, the project is split into several crates:
Odilia &amp;ndash; The main application This is the toplevel binary crate, which glues all the smaller crates together. It also handles logging and other application-wide tasks.
atspi &amp;ndash; Accessibility Interface This crate communicates with the Assistive Technology Service Provider Interface, which allows Odilia to access and present the content in applications and the desktop environment.</description><category>doc</category></item><item><title>Useful Links</title><link>https://odilia.app/doc/devel/useful-links/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Aug 2022 15:07:41 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/doc/devel/useful-links/</guid><description>AT-SPI General overview, with several links Accessible Document Navigation Using AT-SPI API documentation Examples, including Javascript, C and Python Examples exclusively using py-atspi2, the human-generated bindings, not the ones generated via GObject Introspection Odilia&amp;rsquo;s atspi crate Speech libspeech library documentation Speech Synthesis Interface Protocol (SSIP) API documentation Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.1 Raw FFI Rust bindings to libspeech Idiomatic Rust bindings to libspeech, what we&amp;rsquo;re currently using Pure Rust interface to speech-dispatcher, what we&amp;rsquo;d like to use Odilia&amp;rsquo;s tts crate Braille Liblouis users and programmers manual Liblouis bindings for rust, for braille tables and multiple braille codes, including those for the majority of languages Libbrlapi reference manual</description><category>doc</category></item><item><title>Installing Odilia</title><link>https://odilia.app/doc/user/installation/</link><pubDate>Sun, 24 Jul 2022 14:03:55 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/doc/user/installation/</guid><description>Requirements Odilia should run on any Unix-like platform with the required dependencies supported by Rust . Currently, we primarily target Linux, however, we plan to support other free operating systems such as *BSD in the future (patches welcome).
The following dependencies are required to build and run Odilia:
Build Dependencies Rust Runtime Dependenceis speech-dispatcher &amp;gt;= 0.9 - text to speech daemon at-spi2-core - accessibility infrastructure Odilia doesn&amp;rsquo;t use libatspi, it interacts with AT-SPI over DBus directly, but the daemon must be running.</description><category>doc</category></item><item><title>Odilia Users Guide</title><link>https://odilia.app/doc/user/guide/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jul 2022 13:27:16 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/doc/user/guide/</guid><description>Odilia should start speaking immediately when started.
Some things may feel different.
What Works Caret navigation. Tab navigation. aria-live regions on a web page will speak in real time. What Doesn&amp;rsquo;t Work Terminals &amp;ndash; Odilia will read the entire buffer, not just the new lines. Key bindings Structural navigation</description><category>doc</category></item><item><title>Odilia Version 0.1.0 Released</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/release_0-1-0/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Mar 2023 22:30:18 -0600</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/release_0-1-0/</guid><description>After many months, in fact, just over a year of hard work, we are proud to announce the initial, beta release of Odilia: a new, fast, lightweight screenreader for Linux, written in rust for maximum speed and efficiency.
Thanks to all the others who have been instrumental in making Odilia possible:

Currently, key bindings are very hard to register across arbitrary desktop environments. We will be working on this for the next release.
How do I change my speech rate? Your speech rate must be changed in your speech dispatcher settings. This is often in a file called speechd.conf either in your $XDG_HOME directory, or in /etc/speech-dispatcher/. The value you want to change is DefaultRate. It accepts a value between 0 and 100.</description><category>doc</category></item><item><title>Join the Odilia Community!</title><link>https://odilia.app/community/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Jun 2022 16:36:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/community/</guid><description>The Odilia dev team regularly hangs out in our Matrix space: #odilia-screen-reader:matrix.org.

to actually implement the real thing. The prototype code, while functional, prioritised experimentation over quality,
and thus we&amp;rsquo;ll be throwing almost all of it out completely, but the code is far less important than the experience we
gained from writing it.&lt;/p></description><category>news</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">prototype</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">release</category></item><item><title>Enough Prototypes, let's do this for real</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/enough-prototypes/</link><pubDate>Wed, 02 Feb 2022 12:06:49 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/enough-prototypes/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of afew days ago, we decided we played enough with the tools and components of the linux accessibility stack to be
able to say that we aren&amp;rsquo;t so ignorant anymore, we know at least the basics about how it all fits together, how our
screenreaders read information from a linux gui app, how the gui toolkit and atspi work together to provide the required
context for such tools to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you with code snippets, git logs, conversations from who knows how much time ago and so on, I
will quickly give you a rundown of everything we learned during this long, laborious but nevertheless fun and
educational journey&lt;/p></description><category>news</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">prototype</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">rust</category></item><item><title>Design</title><link>https://odilia.app/design/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jan 2022 11:22:33 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/design/</guid><description>Event Based Design Since Node.js was introduced to the market, the web space has enjoyed more scalable and responsive systems, due to Node&amp;rsquo;s event driven architecture, where every system is loosely coupled to one another, where asynchronous programming, events and messages govern the program flow, therefore making traditional performance bottlenecks like disk i/o, database access and others nearly insignificant, since access to such resources is properly managed and interested parties are notified whenever such a resource is free to use.</description></item><item><title>The First Prototype Has been Released!</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/first-prototype/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:45:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/first-prototype/</guid><description>We know it has been a long time, however we are delighted to inform you that the first Odilia prototype is up on GitHub, with a very early alpha stage build for anyone curious enough to try it out.
If you want to try it out, the link is here:

the screen reader can&amp;rsquo;t do much at the moment, however this is what it can do so far
like any normal screen reader, it can read most components exposed by the Linux accessibility interface, such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.</description><category>news</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">prototype</category><category domain="https://odilia.apptags">release</category></item><item><title>Minimal speech-dispatcher Bindings Created</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/minimal-speech-dispatcher-bindings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:24:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/minimal-speech-dispatcher-bindings/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of afew days ago, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/odilia-app/tts_subsystem">minimal binding to speech-dispatcher&lt;/a> (the TTS system for Linux) was created, which
