If you want to try it out, the link is here:
https://github.com/yggdrasil-sr/yggdrasil-prototype/releases/
the screen reader can&amp;rsquo;t do much at the moment, however this is what it can do so far
like any normal screen reader, it can read most components exposed by the Linux accessibility interface, such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.</description></item><item><title>Minimal speech-dispatcher Bindings Created</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/minimal-speech-dispatcher-bindings/</link><pubDate>Wed, 22 Sep 2021 15:24:01 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/minimal-speech-dispatcher-bindings/</guid><description>&lt;p>As of afew days ago, a &lt;a href="https://github.com/odilia-app/tts_subsystem">minimal binding to speech-dispatcher&lt;/a> (the TTS system for Linux) was created, which
