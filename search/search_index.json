We want to change that. Yggdrasil is a new project that aims to create a better Linux screen reader, written in Rust . Through this project, we aim to provide a better screen reading experience than the one we currently have in Orca . A screen reader with all the modern features a Windows or macOS user would expect from their computers, some of which are outlined below. Features \u00b6 First-class addon support \u00b6 We want our users to be able to do anything they wish with our screen reader. Improving support for specific programs should ideally be doable without needing to modify yggdrasil\u2019s core code. We plan to make it easy to write addons primarily in Lua , with the option to use other languages such as Rust in the future for higher performance. Flexible input and gesture system \u00b6 Likewise, adding new functionality such as new keyboard commands should be easy enough, without needing to tinker with the source code of the screen reader. Manual editing of the configuration files as well as an intuitive grafical program to modify gestures and define new actions will be available. Modern navigation patterns \u00b6 In a perfect world, apps would just be accessible automatically, However, that\u2019s almost never the case. Therefore, visually impaired people rely on additional tools provided by their screen reader, such as object navigation, a way to explore the accessibility tree of an app without relying on focus, being then able to discover unfocusable elements that have important information nevertheless. We have this in NVDA and other screen readers, but not in Orca and as such, not in linux. Yggdrasil will address that. Why the Name? \u00b6 In norse mythology, yggdrasil is a huge tree around which the nine worlds gravitate. It\u2019s seen as a unifyer of everything, since its roots reach to the center of the earth. It\u2019s so large that parts of it exist in other universes. Similarly to the tree of life that unifies everything, We believe accessibility should unify people from across the globe to enjoy a product, with disability no longer being an impediment to the person efficiently using it. They should be able to use technology as well as, if not better than a non-disabled individual. announcements and news \u00b6 Here is the section where important announcements and news about yggdrasil\u2019s development will be published. Each section is delimited by a heading of level 3 or greater. minimal speech system completed \u00b6 As of afew days ago, a minimal binding to speech dispatcher(the tts system for linux) was stabilised. As you could anticipate by now, that means the speaking component of the screen reader is ready to be used, both in yggdrasil(when the at-spi components will be made) as well as in other crates that need linux only tts. In my view, that can\u2019t mean anything else but one step closer to the first yggdrasil prototype.

Inspired by this design, we decided to make the screen reader as event based as possible. Eventually the goal is to be able to abstract away the event sources in interfaces implementable by other components, therefore paving the way for alternative input methods. For this to be doable, we\u2019d need roughly the following to be implemented: An event manager(runs on the main thread) this is the central hub for events. From here, events are received by system services like at-spi, atk and so on, then propagated to the components interested in that particular event. Note: Each component should register with the hub for every event it wants to recieve. The event hub should also reference the at-spi registry, and should register all the events the entire screen reader needs, then propagate them to the appropriate components. Running on another thread should not only be discouraged, but actively prohibited, for example by not implementing send and sync. Component protocol(can run on multiple threads) this is the protocol every component should adhere to. It should include methods for sending and receiving events. Basically, every component should be thread-safe, the only way they communicate to the event hub being through a channel, for example rust\u2019s mpsc. The hub holds all the events in an array of data structures that, among other things, include the sending half of an mpsc channel for each of the registered components. Keyboard/alternative input method component, UI component, speech component, etc specific implementations of the component protocol. Each component should deal with one, and only one, subsystem of the screen reader, sending proper events to the event hub for further propagation and handling by other systems if needed, for example the keyboard handler sends insert+q>goes to hub>goes to gesture manager>goes to quit>resource cleanup and quit program. Speech \u00b6 As we want to make sure our screen reader integrates with the linux ecosystem and the existing tools as much as possible, we decided we will use speech dispatcher as the speech platform Each speech related setting will be saved on a per screen reader, per user basis by default. However, we consider the possibility to include a utility that allows modification of the global speech dispatcher configuration. Whether this is achievable depends on how stable the speech-dispatcher config format is, and if we can reverse engineer it or find some kind of formal spec. We can use the nom crate to parse it. Though the default speech system will be speech dispatcher, we will try to make it possible to allow addons to define their own speech systems, though this is certainly lower priority, as writing a speech-dispatcher module is very easy and allows the synth to be used with other Linux tools. Object Navigation \u00b6 Like in NVDA for Windows, this should follow the accessibility hierarchy as much as possible. This should be done in the way users of screen readers with such features expect, a left/right command to navigate to the previous/next sibling of the object in focus, up to go to the parent object(if any), down to go to the children of an object(if any). Addons \u00b6 Note: This section needs improvement and more discussion, however these are the ideas and plans so far This section of the design document has concepts from the android app format(.apk.), as I think it\u2019s briliantly designed an addon, before installation, is a zip archive that\u2019s digitally signed to verify the author\u2019s authenticity. It is composed of the following: A manifest file, named always manifest.json Defines metadata about the addon, such as its name, version, author, minimal Ygdrassil version, capabilities, programming language, documentation links or local documentation, etc. The addon bundle The code of the addon itself. depending on the language declared in the manifest, the addon will be searched in the following locations within the archive for lua addons, it will be searched in lib/$addon_name.lua. The addon will be loaded through the lua module mechanism, a.k.a require. for C or rust addons, it will be searched in lib/$target_tripple/lib$addon_name.so. This will be loaded through the dynamic linkage procedures in linux. Note: We may allow addons to be written in other languages, such as C, using a custom addon subsystem that could be installed as an addon itself. However, installing such addons will warn the user that they could cause Yggdrasil to become unstable due to things like memory leaks or segmentation faults, and that we are not responsible for these crashes, which should be reported to the addon developers. This arrises from the fact that addons run in the same process as Yggdrasil, so if one crashes, it could bring Yggdrasil down with it. Languages that are memory safe, such as Rust, or garbage collected languages like Lua, won\u2019t produce a warning, as the risk of them crashing the entire screen reader are much lower, if not zero. Addon Distribution \u00b6 We intend to provide a central distribution platform for addons, for easy installation and discovery by the users. Like any extension store, features like searching, filtering and so on will be available, as well as automatic updating upon the users choice. Since this is a public addon platform, we will have to make sure our users don\u2019t get infected due to the addons distributed through it, therefore In order to be published on the store, an addon needs to be digitally signed with a certificate that uniquely identifies the entity or organisation responsible for its development and distribution. a static analysis of the archive would comense whenever a new version is uploaded. This could include scanning of the manifest file for dubious sets of intitlements, a submition of the binary files to virustotal, etc. Of course, we will encourage developers to make use of unit testing, and down the road could provide a unit testing framework that simulates the Yggdrasil addon API that can be used to programatically test addon functionality. However, with a specific setting in the screen reader, the user can allow the installation of extensions not distributed through the store. Then, the addon manager would allow browsing to an addon file and install it. Included Addons \u00b6 In the spirit of modularity and collaboration potential, and because we want our addon api to be as bulletprufe, efficient to use and clearly documented as possible, most of the not strictly needed but useful components as comodity features(what is strictly not necesary to operate the core) will be included with the distribution as addons. Per the users choices, some of those can be disabled or even uninstalled, cutting down on the installed size. ocr \u00b6 The ocr system will have two modes: NVDA Style OCR \u00b6 The ocr results open in a different window, the user being able to click pieces of text for the mouse to perform a click at the desired location in the real window. This would also be the fastest way to perform even arbitrary ocr, as the ocr info is available to addons, so the window doesn\u2019t necesarily need to pop open, exactly like nvda. this is under discussion, if it\u2019s indeed possible to do such things with the current open source accessibility stack we have. Innovative OCR \u00b6 This mode doesn\u2019t attempt to open a new window, instead it overlays the ocr within the current one. Based on the control\u2019s shape, position and color, yggdrasil will try to make an accessible tree for that window, recognising the controll type and using the captured text as the controll text if applicable. Of course, because of the error probability being so high, there would be a possibility for the user to define controlls manually based on the mouse position and providing the text, or make improvements to the already generated ocr result, then saving it as a file that can be distributed. Of course such tweeks will be resolution dependent, but probably the utility will try to correct it as much as possible to fit the application by finding the greattest similarity to both the text and coords and controll type from the provided database in the ocred text. Sound Themes (Earcons) \u00b6 For a long time, mobile device users have had earcons, a sound representation of each control and element type on the current interface. Due to that, such users don\u2019t need to wait for the speech to arrive to the controll type, as it\u2019s obvious what it is based on the specific sound. NVDA uses an addon called audio themes together with unspoken to deliver this functionality which, while not perfect and can lag sometimes, at least tryes to accomplish the same level of efficiency as the mobile experience and manages for the most part. While proliminary support for audio has been implemented in Orca, it hasn\u2019t been expanded on since, and as far as we know, the only thing that uses it is progress bar beeps. Yggdrasil will implement this as an addon that\u2019s part of the distribution, since its another unnecesary feature for the functioning of the screen reader, even though it increases productivity. Eventually, it would also be nice to support positional audio for earcons, so the user knows where the control they\u2019re interacting is on screen. Gesture System \u00b6 The system needs to be as flexible as possible, so the gesture system will be an event component implementing the above mentioned protocol. First, it takes all the raw user actions as events from the hub, registering them all, like key presses, touch gestures and other user-generated commands through alternative input methods. Then, it reads the gestures configuration file, or maybe database. When it finds the gesture corresponding to the event it got from the hub, it reads the action for that, constructs the appropriate event, sending it to the event hub to be processed and dispatched to the correct component.

Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification. Examples of transparent image formats include PNG, XCF and JPG. Opaque formats include proprietary formats that can be read and edited only by proprietary word processors, SGML or XML for which the DTD and/or processing tools are not generally available, and the machine-generated HTML, PostScript or PDF produced by some word processors for output purposes only. The \u201cTitle Page\u201d means, for a printed book, the title page itself, plus such following pages as are needed to hold, legibly, the material this License requires to appear in the title page. For works in formats which do not have any title page as such, \u201cTitle Page\u201d means the text near the most prominent appearance of the work\u2019s title, preceding the beginning of the body of the text. The \u201cpublisher\u201d means any person or entity that distributes copies of the Document to the public. A section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d means a named subunit of the Document whose title either is precisely XYZ or contains XYZ in parentheses following text that translates XYZ in another language. (Here XYZ stands for a specific section name mentioned below, such as \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, \u201cEndorsements\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d.) To \u201cPreserve the Title\u201d of such a section when you modify the Document means that it remains a section \u201cEntitled XYZ\u201d according to this definition. The Document may include Warranty Disclaimers next to the notice which states that this License applies to the Document. These Warranty Disclaimers are considered to be included by reference in this License, but only as regards disclaiming warranties: any other implication that these Warranty Disclaimers may have is void and has no effect on the meaning of this License. 2. VERBATIM COPYING \u00b6 You may copy and distribute the Document in any medium, either commercially or noncommercially, provided that this License, the copyright notices, and the license notice saying this License applies to the Document are reproduced in all copies, and that you add no other conditions whatsoever to those of this License. You may not use technical measures to obstruct or control the reading or further copying of the copies you make or distribute. However, you may accept compensation in exchange for copies. If you distribute a large enough number of copies you must also follow the conditions in section 3. You may also lend copies, under the same conditions stated above, and you may publicly display copies. 3. COPYING IN QUANTITY \u00b6 If you publish printed copies (or copies in media that commonly have printed covers) of the Document, numbering more than 100, and the Document\u2019s license notice requires Cover Texts, you must enclose the copies in covers that carry, clearly and legibly, all these Cover Texts: Front-Cover Texts on the front cover, and Back-Cover Texts on the back cover. Both covers must also clearly and legibly identify you as the publisher of these copies. The front cover must present the full title with all words of the title equally prominent and visible. You may add other material on the covers in addition. Copying with changes limited to the covers, as long as they preserve the title of the Document and satisfy these conditions, can be treated as verbatim copying in other respects. If the required texts for either cover are too voluminous to fit legibly, you should put the first ones listed (as many as fit reasonably) on the actual cover, and continue the rest onto adjacent pages. If you publish or distribute Opaque copies of the Document numbering more than 100, you must either include a machine-readable Transparent copy along with each Opaque copy, or state in or with each Opaque copy a computer-network location from which the general network-using public has access to download using public-standard network protocols a complete Transparent copy of the Document, free of added material. If you use the latter option, you must take reasonably prudent steps, when you begin distribution of Opaque copies in quantity, to ensure that this Transparent copy will remain thus accessible at the stated location until at least one year after the last time you distribute an Opaque copy (directly or through your agents or retailers) of that edition to the public. It is requested, but not required, that you contact the authors of the Document well before redistributing any large number of copies, to give them a chance to provide you with an updated version of the Document. 4. MODIFICATIONS \u00b6 You may copy and distribute a Modified Version of the Document under the conditions of sections 2 and 3 above, provided that you release the Modified Version under precisely this License, with the Modified Version filling the role of the Document, thus licensing distribution and modification of the Modified Version to whoever possesses a copy of it. In addition, you must do these things in the Modified Version: A. Use in the Title Page (and on the covers, if any) a title distinct from that of the Document, and from those of previous versions (which should, if there were any, be listed in the History section of the Document). You may use the same title as a previous version if the original publisher of that version gives permission. B. List on the Title Page, as authors, one or more persons or entities responsible for authorship of the modifications in the Modified Version, together with at least five of the principal authors of the Document (all of its principal authors, if it has fewer than five), unless they release you from this requirement. C. State on the Title page the name of the publisher of the Modified Version, as the publisher. D. Preserve all the copyright notices of the Document. E. Add an appropriate copyright notice for your modifications adjacent to the other copyright notices. F. Include, immediately after the copyright notices, a license notice giving the public permission to use the Modified Version under the terms of this License, in the form shown in the Addendum below. G. Preserve in that license notice the full lists of Invariant Sections and required Cover Texts given in the Document\u2019s license notice. H. Include an unaltered copy of this License. I. Preserve the section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d, Preserve its Title, and add to it an item stating at least the title, year, new authors, and publisher of the Modified Version as given on the Title Page. If there is no section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the Document, create one stating the title, year, authors, and publisher of the Document as given on its Title Page, then add an item describing the Modified Version as stated in the previous sentence. J. Preserve the network location, if any, given in the Document for public access to a Transparent copy of the Document, and likewise the network locations given in the Document for previous versions it was based on. These may be placed in the \u201cHistory\u201d section. You may omit a network location for a work that was published at least four years before the Document itself, or if the original publisher of the version it refers to gives permission. K. For any section Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d or \u201cDedications\u201d, Preserve the Title of the section, and preserve in the section all the substance and tone of each of the contributor acknowledgements and/or dedications given therein. L. Preserve all the Invariant Sections of the Document, unaltered in their text and in their titles. Section numbers or the equivalent are not considered part of the section titles. M. Delete any section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. Such a section may not be included in the Modified Version. N. Do not retitle any existing section to be Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d or to conflict in title with any Invariant Section. O. Preserve any Warranty Disclaimers. If the Modified Version includes new front-matter sections or appendices that qualify as Secondary Sections and contain no material copied from the Document, you may at your option designate some or all of these sections as invariant. To do this, add their titles to the list of Invariant Sections in the Modified Version\u2019s license notice. These titles must be distinct from any other section titles. You may add a section Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d, provided it contains nothing but endorsements of your Modified Version by various parties\u2014for example, statements of peer review or that the text has been approved by an organization as the authoritative definition of a standard. You may add a passage of up to five words as a Front-Cover Text, and a passage of up to 25 words as a Back-Cover Text, to the end of the list of Cover Texts in the Modified Version. Only one passage of Front-Cover Text and one of Back-Cover Text may be added by (or through arrangements made by) any one entity. If the Document already includes a cover text for the same cover, previously added by you or by arrangement made by the same entity you are acting on behalf of, you may not add another; but you may replace the old one, on explicit permission from the previous publisher that added the old one. The author(s) and publisher(s) of the Document do not by this License give permission to use their names for publicity for or to assert or imply endorsement of any Modified Version. 5. COMBINING DOCUMENTS \u00b6 You may combine the Document with other documents released under this License, under the terms defined in section 4 above for modified versions, provided that you include in the combination all of the Invariant Sections of all of the original documents, unmodified, and list them all as Invariant Sections of your combined work in its license notice, and that you preserve all their Warranty Disclaimers. The combined work need only contain one copy of this License, and multiple identical Invariant Sections may be replaced with a single copy. If there are multiple Invariant Sections with the same name but different contents, make the title of each such section unique by adding at the end of it, in parentheses, the name of the original author or publisher of that section if known, or else a unique number. Make the same adjustment to the section titles in the list of Invariant Sections in the license notice of the combined work. In the combination, you must combine any sections Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d in the various original documents, forming one section Entitled \u201cHistory\u201d; likewise combine any sections Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, and any sections Entitled \u201cDedications\u201d. You must delete all sections Entitled \u201cEndorsements\u201d. 6. COLLECTIONS OF DOCUMENTS \u00b6 You may make a collection consisting of the Document and other documents released under this License, and replace the individual copies of this License in the various documents with a single copy that is included in the collection, provided that you follow the rules of this License for verbatim copying of each of the documents in all other respects. You may extract a single document from such a collection, and distribute it individually under this License, provided you insert a copy of this License into the extracted document, and follow this License in all other respects regarding verbatim copying of that document. 7. AGGREGATION WITH INDEPENDENT WORKS \u00b6 A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an \u201caggregate\u201d if the copyright resulting from the compilation is not used to limit the legal rights of the compilation\u2019s users beyond what the individual works permit. When the Document is included in an aggregate, this License does not apply to the other works in the aggregate which are not themselves derivative works of the Document. If the Cover Text requirement of section 3 is applicable to these copies of the Document, then if the Document is less than one half of the entire aggregate, the Document\u2019s Cover Texts may be placed on covers that bracket the Document within the aggregate, or the electronic equivalent of covers if the Document is in electronic form. Otherwise they must appear on printed covers that bracket the whole aggregate. 8. TRANSLATION \u00b6 Translation is considered a kind of modification, so you may distribute translations of the Document under the terms of section 4. Replacing Invariant Sections with translations requires special permission from their copyright holders, but you may include translations of some or all Invariant Sections in addition to the original versions of these Invariant Sections. You may include a translation of this License, and all the license notices in the Document, and any Warranty Disclaimers, provided that you also include the original English version of this License and the original versions of those notices and disclaimers. In case of a disagreement between the translation and the original version of this License or a notice or disclaimer, the original version will prevail. If a section in the Document is Entitled \u201cAcknowledgements\u201d, \u201cDedications\u201d, or \u201cHistory\u201d, the requirement (section 4) to Preserve its Title (section 1) will typically require changing the actual title. 9. TERMINATION \u00b6 You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Document except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, if you cease all violation of this License, then your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a) provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, if the copyright holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means prior to 60 days after the cessation. Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated permanently if the copyright holder notifies you of the violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have received notice of violation of this License (for any work) from that copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after your receipt of the notice. Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under this License. If your rights have been terminated and not permanently reinstated, receipt of a copy of some or all of the same material does not give you any rights to use it. 10. FUTURE REVISIONS OF THIS LICENSE \u00b6 The Free Software Foundation may publish new, revised versions of the GNU Free Documentation License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns. See https://www.gnu.org/licenses/ . Each version of the License is given a distinguishing version number. If the Document specifies that a particular numbered version of this License \u201cor any later version\u201d applies to it, you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that specified version or of any later version that has been published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose any version ever published (not as a draft) by the Free Software Foundation. If the Document specifies that a proxy can decide which future versions of this License can be used, that proxy\u2019s public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you to choose that version for the Document. 11. RELICENSING \u00b6 \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration Site\u201d (or \u201cMMC Site\u201d) means any World Wide Web server that publishes copyrightable works and also provides prominent facilities for anybody to edit those works. A public wiki that anybody can edit is an example of such a server. A \u201cMassive Multiauthor Collaboration\u201d (or \u201cMMC\u201d) contained in the site means any set of copyrightable works thus published on the MMC site. \u201cCC-BY-SA\u201d means the Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 3.0 license published by Creative Commons Corporation, a not-for-profit corporation with a principal place of business in San Francisco, California, as well as future copyleft versions of that license published by that same organization. \u201cIncorporate\u201d means to publish or republish a Document, in whole or in part, as part of another Document. An MMC is \u201celigible for relicensing\u201d if it is licensed under this License, and if all works that were first published under this License somewhere other than this MMC, and subsequently incorporated in whole or in part into the MMC, (1) had no cover texts or invariant sections, and (2) were thus incorporated prior to November 1, 2008. The operator of an MMC Site may republish an MMC contained in the site under CC-BY-SA on the same site at any time before August 1, 2009, provided the MMC is eligible for relicensing. ADDENDUM: How to use this License for your documents \u00b6 To use this License in a document you have written, include a copy of the License in the document and put the following copyright and license notices just after the title page: Copyright ( C ) YEAR YOUR NAME . Permission is granted to copy , distribute and / or modify this document under the terms of the GNU Free Documentation License , Version 1.3 or any later version published by the Free Software Foundation ; with no Invariant Sections , no Front - Cover Texts , and no Back - Cover Texts . A copy of the license is included in the section entitled \"GNU Free Documentation License \". If you have Invariant Sections, Front-Cover Texts and Back-Cover Texts, replace the \u201cwith \u2026 Texts.\u201d line with this: with the Invariant Sections being LIST THEIR TITLES , with the Front - Cover Texts being LIST , and with the Back - Cover Texts being LIST . If you have Invariant Sections without Cover Texts, or some other combination of the three, merge those two alternatives to suit the situation. If your document contains nontrivial examples of program code, we recommend releasing these examples in parallel under your choice of free software license, such as the GNU General Public License, to permit their use in free software.","title":"Fdl 1.3"},{"location":"fdl-1.3/#gnu-free-documentation-license","text":"Version 1.3, 3 November 2008 Copyright (C) 2000, 2001, 2002, 2007, 2008 Free Software Foundation, Inc. https://fsf.org/ Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.","title":"GNU Free Documentation License"},{"location":"fdl-1.3/#0-preamble","text":"The purpose of this License is to make a manual, textbook, or other functional and useful document \u201cfree\u201d in the sense of freedom: to assure everyone the effective freedom to copy and redistribute it, with or without modifying it, either commercially or noncommercially. Secondarily, this License preserves for the author and publisher a way to get credit for their work, while not being considered responsible for modifications made by others.

Such a notice grants a world-wide, royalty-free license, unlimited in duration, to use that work under the conditions stated herein. The \u201cDocument\u201d, below, refers to any such manual or work. Any member of the public is a licensee, and is addressed as \u201cyou\u201d. You accept the license if you copy, modify or distribute the work in a way requiring permission under copyright law. A \u201cModified Version\u201d of the Document means any work containing the Document or a portion of it, either copied verbatim, or with modifications and/or translated into another language. A \u201cSecondary Section\u201d is a named appendix or a front-matter section of the Document that deals exclusively with the relationship of the publishers or authors of the Document to the Document\u2019s overall subject (or to related matters) and contains nothing that could fall directly within that overall subject. (Thus, if the Document is in part a textbook of mathematics, a Secondary Section may not explain any mathematics.) The relationship could be a matter of historical connection with the subject or with related matters, or of legal, commercial, philosophical, ethical or political position regarding them. The \u201cInvariant Sections\u201d are certain Secondary Sections whose titles are designated, as being those of Invariant Sections, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. If a section does not fit the above definition of Secondary then it is not allowed to be designated as Invariant. The Document may contain zero Invariant Sections. If the Document does not identify any Invariant Sections then there are none. The \u201cCover Texts\u201d are certain short passages of text that are listed, as Front-Cover Texts or Back-Cover Texts, in the notice that says that the Document is released under this License. A Front-Cover Text may be at most 5 words, and a Back-Cover Text may be at most 25 words. A \u201cTransparent\u201d copy of the Document means a machine-readable copy, represented in a format whose specification is available to the general public, that is suitable for revising the document straightforwardly with generic text editors or (for images composed of pixels) generic paint programs or (for drawings) some widely available drawing editor, and that is suitable for input to text formatters or for automatic translation to a variety of formats suitable for input to text formatters. A copy made in an otherwise Transparent file format whose markup, or absence of markup, has been arranged to thwart or discourage subsequent modification by readers is not Transparent. An image format is not Transparent if used for any substantial amount of text. A copy that is not \u201cTransparent\u201d is called \u201cOpaque\u201d. Examples of suitable formats for Transparent copies include plain ASCII without markup, Texinfo input format, LaTeX input format, SGML or XML using a publicly available DTD, and standard-conforming simple HTML, PostScript or PDF designed for human modification.
