able to say that we aren&amp;rsquo;t so ignorant anymore, we know at least the basics about how it all fits together, how our
screenreaders read information from a linux gui app, how the gui toolkit and atspi work together to provide the required
context for such tools to operate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since I don&amp;rsquo;t want to bore you with code snippets, git logs, conversations from who knows how much time ago and so on, I
will quickly give you a rundown of everything we learned during this long, laborious but nevertheless fun and
educational journey&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>The First Prototype Has been Released!</title><link>https://odilia.app/news/first-prototype/</link><pubDate>Tue, 26 Oct 2021 22:45:41 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://odilia.app/news/first-prototype/</guid><description>We know it has been a long time, however we are delighted to inform you that the first Odilia prototype is up on GitHub, with a very early alpha stage build for anyone curious enough to try it out.
If you want to try it out, the link is here:
https://github.com/yggdrasil-sr/yggdrasil-prototype/releases/
the screen reader can&amp;rsquo;t do much at the moment, however this is what it can do so far
like any normal screen reader, it can read most components exposed by the Linux accessibility interface, such as buttons, checkboxes, radio buttons, etc.</description></item></channel></rss>
